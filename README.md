Do you want to manage your monthly budget more efficiently? Do you want to know how much you spend on different categories of expenses, such as transport, food, entertainment, etc.? If so, you might be interested in our website that tracks your monthly expends. 

Our website allows you to set a monthly limit for each category of expense, and then record every transaction you make within that category. For example, if you set a limit of $100 for transport, and then spend $20 on a taxi ride, our website will automatically deduct that amount from your limit and show you how much money remains for transport in the current month. 

You can also view your spending history, compare your spending habits with other users, and get personalized tips on how to save money and reduce unnecessary expenses. Our website is easy to use, secure, and free. All you need to do is sign up with your email address and start tracking your monthly expends today!
